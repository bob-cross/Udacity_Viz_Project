# Summary
The baseball dataset is a sample of 1,157 Major League Baseball (MLB) players providing their names, height, weight, batting average and home runs hit.
The visual shows a normal distribution of  MLB Batting Averages ranging from .200 to .300 with a mean of .250. Each bar is color coded to show how many players bat right-handed, left-handed or switch hit. The visual highlights batting averages of zero and those below 200; these players are pitchers and often do not bat in MLB. 

# Design
MLB batting averages seemed to be an important aspect of this somewhat limited dataset. Grouping batting averages into uniform ranges seemed to provide a meaningful distribution and such categorical data was then a natural fit for a bar chart. Using the stacked bar chart enabled the visual to incorporate the additional information of the players batting stance. 

# Feedback
Feed back from the initial version was about the clear need to group the data to provide a meaning visual effect. Additional feedback involved naming of the axis and the title. An additional suggestion (not incorporated) was to maybe provide a scatterplot overlay of average home runs per batting average grouping.
